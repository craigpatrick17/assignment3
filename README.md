Craig Patrick: I ran your code in an android emulator, and there seemed to be a problem on line 64. One way that I use to solve the problem of having to guess widths, etc. is to put 'auto' in the width and height areas of the code. After I ran your code using these restraints it seemed to make a difference and actually pull up on my screen. In the future I would just make sure you run your code on an emulator to make sure that it comes up. Other than that the code looks great! The camera funtionality pulled up well on my mac, and the tea display looked great. Good job!
